# ⚔️ Battle Simulation Game 
A turn-based strategy game built in C++.
The project focuses on object-oriented programming, inheritance, and memory management.

# 🔹  Core Features

# Character Classes:
Soldier, Medic, and Sniper — each with unique movement, attack, and reload behavior.

# Game Board:
A dynamic grid (Game class) where characters move, attack, and interact.

# Combat System:
Each character can attack enemies based on range, direction, and special rules.

# Game Logic:
Win condition checks, turn management, and in-game error handling via custom exceptions.

# ⚙️ Technical Highlights

Implemented full class hierarchy from a base Character class.

Used smart pointers (std::shared_ptr) for safe memory handling.

Designed a robust exception system (IllegalCell, OutOfRange, OutOfAmmo, etc.).

Clean and reusable OOP design following inheritance principles.

Integrated with an original SortedList module for internal data handling.

# 🧠 Concepts Used
